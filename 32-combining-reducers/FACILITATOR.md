# Class 32

## How do I prep for today?
Today is an extension of the prior lecture content so you'll need to continue to recap the proper Redux workflow with students and help them understand application state management.

## What changed from yesterday? 
You'll be discussing and including a single entry file for registering reducers within a ReactJS/Redux application.  This change is minor and only really requires the addition of a `combineReducers` Redux method, that accepts all of the reducers in your application.

## What might students struggle with today?
Students will continue to struggle with conceptualizing Redux.  Have your TAs prepared to outline this with students during lab, as needed.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Improper management of application state was surely present in many of the assignment submissions that students made the prior week.  Keep an eye on patterns that showcase a mixture of vanilla ReactJS state management constructs VS only using Redux.
