# Class 31

## How do I prep for today?
It's time to start using Redux for state management.  Having a solid grasp on the 3 principles of Redux, along with the general workflow, is key to explaining this tool to students.  Conceptual diagrams of the Redux workflow are often the most useful way to demostrate how it's used.  Here's an example:

## What changed from yesterday? 
Last week was vanilla state management through the use of ReactJS.  This week, it's all about Redux!

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will need several days to gain a solid understanding of the Redux workflow.  Continue to touch on this during code review each day this week.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
As noted above, the main suprise for students is how complex they perceive the Redux workflow to be.  Placing an emphasis on the concept that Redux was meant to simplify state management may help ease their concerns.
