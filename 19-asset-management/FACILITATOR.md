# Class 18

## How do I prep for today?
Today is all about asset management through the use of AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service).  Review the documentation the S3 module and have a good grasp on how to upload, update, and remove assests from an S3 bucket.  Be sure to setup a developer account in AWS and create a few test buckets and access keys to ensure you are familiar with that process.

## What changed from yesterday?
Today, we hook up the ability to upload a photo!  This is a major milestone for students, be sure to get them excited!

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will struggle with getting their uploads to work properly and remembering how to create keys, buckets, and generally how to configure their application to use the `aws-sdk`.  The routes we create for this day are much more verbose than that of previous routes registered in their app.  Recap, recap, recap to make sure they have an understanding of all of the moving pieces!

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Students will have issues uploading and deleting assets from their S3 bucket.  Be sure to have your TAs ready to address basic issues like key creation, bucket creation, and how to properly configure an upload object for uploading an asset to S3.
