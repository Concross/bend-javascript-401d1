# Class 28

## How do I prep for today?
Today is the first day that students will be modularizing their application components into separate files.  It's also the first day that they'll be working with a frontend router to handle switching between different views of their application.  Have a good understanding of how to utilize `props` and how to "lift" the application state so that your application can achieve a 1-way data flow. Granted the pacing of your lecture allows it, you may have time to discuss the basics of component testing.  There's a bit of configuration involved so be sure to look at the [EnzymeJS](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) and [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) documentation to get a good handle on this.

## What changed from yesterday?
Students will be working with both parent and child components, along with getting additional exposure to component testing. To prepare them for this, code review should include a detailed recap of `<form>`'s and how they are handled within ReacJS.

## What might students struggle with today?
Students will struggle with understanding how to *properly* handle application state, along with the *what*, *why*, and *how* to "lift" it. Spend the time you need covering this - it's worth it both for you and the students and will help prepare them for state management through the use of Redux.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Lot's of bugs and issues related to state management!  Have your TAs ready to review `props` and `state` with students during lab!
