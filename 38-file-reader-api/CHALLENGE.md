===

## Requirements
You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have.  Each character in `S` is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are guaranteed to be distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

example1:
```javascript
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

example2:
```javascript
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

Write at least four tests for this function
* your tests should cover basic (*expected*) functionality
* your tests should consider edge cases for your function (ex: will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?)

## Submission Instructions

1. With your assigned partner, pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. Take a picture of your proposed solution for your repo.
1. Make a new branch and folder in your whiteboard challenge repository on GitHub. The name of the folder should be the same as the name of the challenge.
1. This folder should contain:
	- A file named `solution.js` which contains the JavaScript solution and a comment describing the big O
	- A picture of your pseudocoded solution from the whiteboarding exercise
	- A `README.md` which includes the problem domain
1. Complete the whiteboard challenge in your text editor, and verify that it's functional.
1. Make a pull request from your working branch to your master branch.
1. Submit a link to your PR, or a link to your repo/submission, in Canvas.
