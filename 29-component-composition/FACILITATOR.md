# Class 29

## How do I prep for today?
Today is an extension of the previous lecture content. If you are using a previous lecture demo to prepare, you may notice that they include light layers of refactoring.  Be sure to have a previously built or refactored version to help you prepare.  If you plan on referencing the demos from prior courses, running a `diff` between your previous and current demos should clearly showcase the changes.

## What changed from yesterday? 
The concepts of today and your previous lecture or mostly the same, it's just time to add additional components and help students handle additional complexity within their application state!

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will continue to struggle with state management.  They'll also struggle with the composing their component tree in a meaningful way.  Having TAs readily available to assist with reviewing this concept is a great way to provide support.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Students will struggle with completing their weekly application build as features have been continuously added throughout the week.  If you feel it helps, extend their final application submission by a *day or so*.  This will relieve some pressure and help with their understanding of the material.
