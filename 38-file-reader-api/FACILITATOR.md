# Class 38

## How do I prep for today?
Work with the `FileReader` API to gain an understanding of it's usage.  We'll be using to simply showcase a preview of an uploaded image, to avoid latency issues when uploading to a 3rd party service, like S3.  You can experiment with the `FileReader` API in the browser, which has access to many methods that can be used "on the fly".

## What changed from yesterday? 
Students will be uploading assets to S3 today.  You'll need to explain why we use `attach` within our `superagent` requests to "attach" an image to the body of a request.

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will struggle with getting their images to preview/upload.  Point them to the `FileReader` docs to assist with this.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Other than the above, today's assignment should be fairly easy for students to navigate.
