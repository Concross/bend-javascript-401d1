# Class 13

## How do I prep for today?
Today is all about MongoDB, how to create database schema's through the use of MongooseJS, and generally how to work with a true persistence layer when building a NodeJS and ExpressJS based application.  Be sure to have a solid grasp on basic MongoDB shell commands, how collections are created, how to create a simple database schema with associated constraints.  Placing an emphasis on testing is hugely important during this day, as you'll begin to incorporate many different hooks for adding/removing/cleaning up data from the database before and after tests run.

## What changed from yesterday? 
Today is their first day using a NoSQL DBMS!  Get your students excited about the ability of writing simple javascript commands to do database CRUD operations.  Prior to this day, they have been using a file-system based storage module for persistence - be sure to showcase how their code base drastically shrinks with the addition of MongooseJS schemas and MongoDB as their database!

## What might students struggle with today?
Students will struggle with getting MongoDB up and running.  Windows users will need to account for their `USERNAME:PASSWORD` in their MongoDB connection string and other students may incur improper permissions in certain locations, keeping MongoDB from running.  Be sure to detail the difference between the MongoDB process and the MongoDB shell, along with having your TAs readily available during lab to address the configuration issues noted above. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
As discussed, getting MongoDB setup and running is always a tricky thing.  Set student expecations that there will likely be issues when installing MongoDB and, if need be, to sit back and watch the lecture.  We'll provide support during lab to get their issues addressed.  This keeps us from having to address issues directly in lecture and keeps the flow of content moving.
