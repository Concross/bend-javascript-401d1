# Frontend Tooling & React

## How do I prep for today?
Today is the first day of ReactJS!  Going through the ReactJS documentation, getting started guide, and building a simple ReactJS application is a great way to get started.  Be sure to have a simple, but solid, starting `webpack` set of files prepared -- `webpack.common.js`, `webpack.dev.js`, and `webpack.prod.js`.  Your demo for the day should only utilize vanilla React constructs and all components/logic should be contained in a single file.  This technique is simply meant to ease students into future content that is to come.

On this first day, focus on WHAT React is (there's a great set of slides you can use to assist in this discussion), mainly centered around Component based design.

Spend as much time as you need at 10,000' getting students to understand the concept of components, and how they fit together, along with an index.html and a single .scss file to compose an application.

For the first day, discuss the role webpack and babel play (even show the resulting bundles) but don't get too deep into the weeds of how they work. You should build and deep dive into webpack on days 2 & 3 once you lay the foundations in this lecture.

For the next lecture (Day 27), your "code review" should be a revisit of the basic counter app, and a live converstion/refactor from the `single-file` version into the `modular` version.  This not only gives you a chance to setup the class for understanding modular coding patterns (with respect to components) but also to re-cement the roles of each component from the first lab.

## What changed from yesterday? 
Time for frontend development!

## What might students struggle with today? 
Students will struggle with making the mental transistion out of backend development and into frontend development.  ReactJS abstracts away many of the direct DOM manipulation styles of frontend Javascript development that students are used to.  Be sure to talk about the benefits of a component framework and why it's awesome that they won't have to work about jQuery or vanilla DOM methods anymore!

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Students will struggle with properly configuring Webpack and working through basic debugging within ReactJS.  You are welcome to introduce extra debugging tools, such as the ReactJS Dev Tools Chrome extension, to help with this process!
